hi everyone I'm Jess the executive

producer of Project Loki in these videos

I cover some of the biggest changes

coming in our upcoming play test and our

thinking behind them we have so much to

cover last month we hosted our first

play test in EU and we loved seeing so

many of you try Loki for the first time

you shared a ton of great feedback which

we've been digging into over the past

few weeks one area we weren't satisfied

with was game performance even though

we're still in pre-alpha it's clear we

need to do more to stabilize the game

our server performance and your frame

rates we managed to cut crashes in half

with two mid playay test patches but

that shouldn't be the default option so

prior to this play test we've already

run two smaller tests for stability

including one to upgrade to Unreal 5.2

definitely better that we hit these

issues now than in it launch so thanks

for your patience as for future EU play

tests we're still seeing how feasible it

is to run two separate Regional play

tests every time but this upcoming 3-day

play test will have servers and

exclusive times for EU and na all right

let's talk changes first we have two new

hero in the Prototype phase prototypes

mean we're testing gameplay loops and

mechanics to see what's working before

we move on to art or thematic

exploration what this means is that

their visuals will be very temp usually

a borrowed or recolored model with lots

of placeholder V effects and sound

effects and sometimes a funny hat most

Studios do this part of development

internal only because it requires more

squinting to see and because we expect

to go through several different

iterations in development that said

you've been great at giving feedback on

work in progress kits and we learned so

much more getting them into your hands

so in they go please leave feedback but

don't get attached to anything just yet

I won't go into details on the kits but

one of them is a Melee character so I'll

hit a big Community requested topic and

give some thoughts on melee characters

in Project Loki we said this before but

Loki started out as a much slower MOBA

Style game until we embraced our action

gameplay now we describe ourselves as

more of a mobile with the shooter soul

with a big emphasis on shooter our time

to kill is fast our hero abilities are

sharp and our basic attacks are pretty

lethal we love this combination because

it means you can outplay other teams

even if you're outnumbered but it does

make designing melee Heroes a challenge

we were finding our early melee

prototypes would either die before they

could engage or they would slam on top

of targets and blow them up before they

could react also the melee kits

themselves were feeling a little flat as

players were just swinging mindlessly

when they got into range so entering

this year our goal was to make melee

Heroes more engaging from a playing as

perspective and add more back and forth

between melee Heroes and their ranged

counterparts we now believe that melee

Heroes needed more opportunities for

re-engagement in a skirmish so less 100

to zero moments on either side but more

jockeying for position and employing

hidden run strategies but trying to bake

all of this into melee kits was putting

a lot of other constraints on their

design well what if everyone was a melee

hero hear me out this play test we're

experimenting a universal ability for

all heroes a melee ability

this melee starts Bound in your first

Power slot but we're considering giving

it its own button with it you can knock

enemies back and stun them if they hit a

wall as well as reflecting projectiles

if timed correctly it looks like a punch

but we're calling it a melee to keep AR

thematic options open at a service level

it gives all heroes an accessible

disengaged option especially against

other melees which opens up a lot more

design space we're excited to see what

kinds of plays you can pull off this

test so share your clipse on Discord

Switching gears something you've seen

but we haven't had a chance to talk

about are storm shifts functionally

storm shifts act as game to game

variants that change the behavior of

that game these can be small changes

like Final Destination which lets

everyone know the final location of the

circle all the way to things like

infinite glider field which does what it

says and totally changes your traversal

options getting philosophical storm

shifts are an important future for us

for a couple of reasons first adaptation

is a critical skill in Loki and we don't

want it to feel like there's always a

single optimal strategy second and more

importantly storm shifts are how we

preserve our studio development culture

even through launch I know that sounds

dramatic but it's true my belief is that

we'll always take big swings to evolve

and improve the game even years after

we've launched but it can be hard to do

that if we as players start becoming

change ofers because we're used to

playing the game out a certain way which

really incentivizes designing the game

in a way where it stays the same year

after year luckily this doesn't have to

be true for us storm shifts let us share

some really wild experiments in a

controlled way a reflection of our daily

play testing culture where every morning

we all play Loki as a studio and try out

new changes from the previous day

sometimes these changes are fun but

arguably too crazy for every game of

Loki well how about a storm shift now we

have a way to Play and Learn and

sometimes even discover a mechanic so

good it gets baked into the base game

speaking of experiments every play test

we've been inspired watching our

community share screenshots of

leaderboards for individual Heroes and

wins and wondered if we could do

something more this is still in proti

but we're trying out a new meta system

called hype you gain hype by eliminating

other teams and placing high in your

lobby knocking out another team steals a

portion of their hype and adds it to

your squads every Lobby the team with

the most hype the hype Squad will be

called out and that's as far as our

current experiment goes but if you like

it we're kind of hyped at the

possibilities imagine a world where we

reset this daily and highlight the

biggest hype squad or if the hype Squad

could select the storm shift of the

lobby lots of Poss possibilties so let

us know and keep that hyp rolling okay I

know this video is getting long and this

is normally where I say there's a lot

more in the patch nodes there's a lot

more in patch notes but there's honestly

so much this month that I'm just going

to run through a list of stuff we're

excited about so let's go one we've

removed the landing

slow two all long stuns have had their

duration reduced three we have new

blockouts for Huntress and Ronin as well

as the UAV and Forge four we have lots

of new perks and you can now pre-select

your perks at game start by pressing F2

uh next you now Auto pick up duplicate

items and Enchanted items get their

passive immediately and lastly we have a

new Vault breaking mechanic but there's

even more check the patch notes on

Discord for full details and let us know

if there are any topics you'd like to

hear from us on and I'll see you later

bye
