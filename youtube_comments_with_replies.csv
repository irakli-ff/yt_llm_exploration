"Got to try the playtest and it has great potential, but right now there's too much to worry about especially for new players, to me anyway. With 5-7 abilities, possible 5 consumables, items, pve objectives and pvp, it's a lot on a battle royale map. Hopefully it's slimmed down.",Braden Hazle,2023-11-17T14:00:02Z,Top-level

"Is there a chance for a mode like League/ Dota2 with 3 lanes map and jungle with its towers&minions? Maybe even consider a simple 3vs3 with 1 lane and 1 jungle similar to Vainglory. It doesnt have to be perfect - just to broaden the interests of different playerbase. I can see similarities to Battlerite, which I tried out back then, but dropped since the Battleroyale mode was just not interesting for me as an original moba enjoyer. But the gameplay was pretty smooth.",iLoveCoziness,2023-11-16T02:39:30Z,Top-level

"not a fan of giving everyone access to the same ability. 

generally if every character has access to some ""ability"" it's a band-aid fix for a deeper issue like class imbalance etc. same reason LoL has ""flash"" and everyone takes it. it was pretty balanced early in its life, but now 10+ years later, characters abuse the spell for things that were never intended, and mobility creep has made the spell infinitely better on some characters than others. now they can never remove ""flash"" or it will effectively break the game. 

giving every character access to one tool means you have to design every future character & gameplay mechanic around it. seems great on paper, but can have unforeseen consequences down the line.

a better approach is to ask why it's needed, which characters suffer the most without it, and how you can solve that problem without creating an imbalance. things like interactables in the environment, creative forms of CC, talent/skill upgrades, etc., are better alternatives than ""give everyone X ability"" to create parity.",Sonny Ankau,2023-11-08T07:08:18Z,Top-level

"Will Australia/OCE be able to participate in future playtests?
A healthy roster would likely have ~1/3 melee characters or more. Considering the colour palette and effects, it would be great to have options for the individual player to tone down overlapping effects (similar to how Lost Ark has it). Even though you DO get used to messy effects with time, if this game is going to be 4v4v4v4v4 this is going to get very messy. (Also would be great to be able to have a minimalist HP/Mana bar- they're very chunky and overbearing in the footage).
I would prefer to see the models more robust like Battlerite, as it makes you feel ownership, weightiness of the character and makes it clear how to move around them, rather than the models appearing flat, janky, overstylized slideshows. 
Also err on the slower side of TTK. In later seasons and with players getting more experienced TTK almost always tends to lower in MOBAS and in FPS, which can lose the flavour or alienate new players, or that particular kind of player. Fine balance.",John Smith,2023-11-07T22:32:18Z,Top-level

"I played 1 day with my friend and we stopped because we had legit 0 fun, some of the reason why : 

1) Can't duo
2) We were forced to tag with a random player, and when he had the lead on the drop, we couldn't jump before, we were forced to stay with him and go where he want, even if he's afk till the end, or he jump on a bad spot
3) The mecanic of the game that if you ""fly"" and get hit by enemy make you fall and die instantly end of the game is bad in my opinion.
4) All character with AoE Ult are broken because when we spawn we had all CD up, so we can just nuke an enemy by point and click it all together with unmissable AoE.
5) Less mechanics than Battlerite Royale around the ""jump"" and ""counter"" (on this game each character had 1 jump/dash/blink, and 1 counter/shield, and some other melee character had more than range ofc to be able to reach them). Here it feels like it's random and so some character are broken and some other useless, the game isn't balance, were in Battlerite Royale, all character were playable and played.

I am a huge fan of Battlerite Royale which is dead actually, but was one of my best gaming arc.
The gameplay was perfect, but what made player leave the game was that it's not free at start, and also the matchmaking was not ""new player friendly"".
Maybe you should when the game will be out, put a system that match all new players together during like the 20 first game, then an other group for those who've between 21-50 game played, and finaly group everyone randomly after like more than 50 game.

Without a MMR system (after 50 game) because this thing legit kill the fun of all Battle Royale, and the fun of all the goodplayer / streamer that want to play the game.
MMR is the worst system for BR because technically, if you get in a game of 100 player that are suppose to be at the same lvl than you, you will get 0,5 kill/each game. (you can't kill like 5-10 clone of yourself in row)

BattleRoyal should be natural selection, like darwin theory, put 100 random people together and let them fight thats all.

I know it was a playtest, so i hope you will make the game better in the next playtest/alpha, more like Battlerite Royale in the gameplay with of course, your add of what you think could be great.
I trust your team, you seems very dedicated.

"6:00 Auto-claiming duplicate items is a great qol change.
5:44 Removing slow after landing is not as cool, as those little details make game more nuanced and add to play potential.

"That's a fair point re: landing slow - we have had those discussions but do feel there's a lot of other ways to demonstrate mastery through traversal / chasing, like pathing or  maintaining momentum in other ways.

"Juat listening to these concepts I wanna say a few things:
- A little more TTK is awesome! It kinda gives more time to adapt while not being TOO high that you just get one-shot if you find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time  (my personal taste) 
- Following that last point, I will absolutely try using the Meele mechanic a lot as a movement option cause it sounds great! Both as a kind of risky offensive move and as an awesome reposition tool!
- Storm Shifts sound like that extra variety each game needed to give Loki the best replayabity factor! If done correctly they could be tons of fun, otherwise they could be a pain.
- Hype gives me ""Kill leader"" vibes which will feel good when you manage to outplay the Hype Squad in your game!
